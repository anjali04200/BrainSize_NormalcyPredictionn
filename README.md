# BrainSize_NormalcyPredictionn
This project utilizes machine learning techniques, 
specifically Linear Regression, Logistic Regression and 
Decision Tree algorithms to predict brain size normalcy 
based on the Brain dataset. The dataset is used to train and
 evaluate the performance of these models
